# To-Do App with JavaScript
Keep your fancy list of actions to do.

# How to Use
You can add➕ remove🗑️ and complete✔️ items on your list. New added items will go to the top. The completed items will go to the bottom and will fade. If you click complete✔️ on faded(completed) items they will go back to the original list so you can complete them again.
